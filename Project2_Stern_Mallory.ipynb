      "Using machine learning (ML) for early alert systems of students at-risk in higher edu-\n",
      "cation has been an important application of learning analytics [1–5]. While there \n",
      "many levels of early alert systems, our focus has been on course-level predictions\n",
      "especially in mathematics. The importance of completing calculus in the student’s\n",
      "first attempt is critical in university majors related to science, technology, engineer-\n",

      "itself, we hypothesized that combining data from the student information system (SIS)\n",
